# Phase 1, Step 4: Head Node Network Bonding

* **File:** `04-network-bonding.md`
* **Date:** December 9, 2025
* **Target:** Node 01 (Head Node)
* **OS:** AlmaLinux 9.x
* **Goal:** Aggregate two 10GbE interfaces into a single 20Gbps LACP trunk with a static IP.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
* **Switch Configuration:** The Arista switch ports corresponding to this node must be configured as a Port Channel (LACP).
* **Cabling:** Ensure both 10GbE copper cables are connected.
* **Console Access:** Perform these steps via the local console (IPMI or physical monitor), as network connectivity may drop briefly during reconfiguration.

---

## 2. Interface Identification & Cleanup
Identify the physical device names (e.g., `eno1`, `eno2`).
```bash
nmcli device status
```

Example output:
```
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
eno1    ethernet  disconnected  --
eno2    ethernet  disconnected  --
lo      loopback  unmanaged     --
```

**_Note_**: If STATE shows "connected" to a "Wired connection", proceed to the cleanup step below.

_Cleanup_: Remove any default connections created by NetworkManager during OS installation to prevent conflicts.

```bash
# Replace 'eno1' and 'eno2' with your specific device names
nmcli connection delete eno1
nmcli connection delete eno2
```

---

## 3. Configure the Bond (bond0)
We will configure an 802.3ad (LACP) bond. The lacp_rate=fast option is critical to match the Arista configuration defined in Step 1.

### A. Create the Bond Master

```bash
nmcli connection add type bond con-name bond0 ifname bond0 \
bond.options "mode=802.3ad,miimon=100,lacp_rate=fast"
```

Expected Output:
```
Connection 'bond0' (uuid: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) successfully added.
```

Expected output:
```
Connection 'bond0-port1' (uuid: ...) successfully added. Connection 'bond0-port2' (uuid: ...) successfully added.
```

### B. Add Physical Slaves

Attach the physical 10GbE interfaces to the bond master.
```bash
nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bond con-name bond0-port1 ifname eno1 master bond0
nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bond con-name bond0-port2 ifname eno2 master bond0
```

## 4. IP Configuration (Static)

The Head Node requires a static IP to function as the Cluster Controller and PXE Server.

* **IP Address:** `10.0.0.91`
* **Subnet Mask:** `/16` (255.255.0.0)
* **Gateway:** `10.0.0.254`


```bash
# Set IPv4 to Manual
nmcli connection modify bond0 ipv4.method manual

# Set the Static IP & Subnet
nmcli connection modify bond0 ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.91/16

# Set the Gateway
nmcli connection modify bond0 ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.254

# Set DNS (Google/Cloudflare used as examples, adjust if using University DNS)
nmcli connection modify bond0 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
```

## 5. Activation & Verification
### A. Activate the Bond

```bash
nmcli connection up bond0
```

### B. Verify Link Status

Check that the connection is active and green.

```bash
nmcli connection show
```

### C. Verify LACP Negotiation (Critical)
Use the following checks to confirm the switch negotiation is successful.

1.  **Verify Bonding Mode**
    Ensure the mode is IEEE 802.3ad.
    ```bash
    grep "Bonding Mode" /proc/net/bonding/bond0
    # Expected: Bonding Mode: IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation
    ```

2.  **Verify Partner MAC Address**
    This must match your Arista switch's MAC address. If this is all zeros, the switch is not communicating.
    ```bash
    grep "Partner Mac Address" /proc/net/bonding/bond0
    # Expected: Partner Mac Address: [Your_Switch_MAC]
    ```

3.  **Verify Aggregator ID**
    Ensure all slaves belong to the same Aggregator ID.
    ```bash
    grep "Aggregator ID" /proc/net/bonding/bond0
    # Expected: The IDs shown for Slave Interface eno1 and eno2 must match.
    ```

4.  **Verify Slave Status**
    Both interfaces must be up and active.
    ```bash
    grep "Status" /proc/net/bonding/bond0
    # Expected: Status: up (for both Slave Interface sections)
    ```
