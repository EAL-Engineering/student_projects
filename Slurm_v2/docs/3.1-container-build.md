# Phase 3, Step 1: Building the Scientific Container

* **File:** `3.1-container-build.md`
* **Date:** December 12, 2025
* **Target:** Node 01 (Head Node)
* **Software:** Apptainer, CERN ROOT, Geant4, Talys
* **Goal:** Create the portable `lab-physics-v1.sif` container to standardise the user environment.

---

## 1. Overview

We will package the scientific stack (ROOT, Geant4, Talys) into a single Apptainer container. This container will be built once on the Head Node and then distributed via the NFS share.

We will cache the tarballs locally first to avoid repeatedly downloading large source files during the build process.

**Path Strategy:**
All scientific software will be installed into `/opt` within the container to keep the structure clean and consistent:

* `/opt/root`
* `/opt/geant4`
* `/opt/talys`
* `/opt/bin` (for custom lab utilities)

## 2. Prepare Local Cache

We will download the source tarballs to the Head Node *once*, and then copy them into the container during the build.

Create the build directory:

    mkdir -p /home/eal/containers/build
    cd /home/eal/containers/build

**Download Sources (Run these commands on the Head Node):**

    # 1. Custom Utilities (Assumed present on host)
    cp /usr/local/bin/mvme2xy .
    cp /usr/local/bin/dat2xy .

    # 2. Geant4 11.4.0 Source
    wget https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/archive/v11.4.0/geant4-v11.4.0.tar.bz2

    # 3. Talys 2.0 Source
    wget https://nds.iaea.org/talys/talys.tar

## 3. Interactive Verification (Sandbox Mode)

Before creating the final definition file, we will verify the installation steps. Apptainer allows you to boot a writable "sandbox" (directory) to test commands line-by-line.

### Step 3.1: Create and Enter Sandbox

    # Build a basic sandbox from the AlmaLinux base
    sudo apptainer build --sandbox chroot_test/ docker://almalinux:9
    
    # Enter the sandbox in writable mode
    sudo apptainer shell --writable chroot_test/

**Step 3.2: Copy Assets (Manual Simulation)**
*Inside the sandbox shell*, manually copy the files to `/tmp` to simulate what the `%files` section will do. (Note: You may need to open a second terminal on the host to copy files *into* `chroot_test/tmp/` if you cannot access the host mounts).

**Step 3.3: Test Installation Commands**
Run the following block of commands inside the sandbox. These are the exact commands that will go into the `lab-physics.def` file. **If any command fails, fix it here and update your draft definition file.**

    # --- System Prerequisites ---
    dnf install epel-release
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
    dnf update
    
    # --- Install Build Tools ---
    dnf install gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran make cmake git wget which tar bzip2
    dnf install expat-devel xerces-c-devel libX11-devel libXmu-devel
    
    # --- Install CERN ROOT ---
    dnf install root python3-root
    
    # --- Create Standard Paths ---
    mkdir -p /opt/bin
    
    # --- Test Talys Compilation ---
    # (Assuming you mapped/copied the tarball to /tmp/talys.tar)
    cd /opt
    tar -xf /tmp/talys.tar
    cd /opt/talys/source
    gfortran -c *.f *.f90
    gfortran *.o -o talys
    mv talys /opt/bin/talys
    rm -f *.o
    # Verify it runs:
    /opt/bin/talys < /dev/null
    
    # --- Test Geant4 Compilation ---
    # (Assuming you mapped/copied to /tmp/geant4-source.tar.bz2)
    mkdir -p /opt/src
    cd /opt/src
    tar -xjf /tmp/geant4-source.tar.bz2
    mkdir -p /opt/src/geant4-v11.4.0/build
    cd /opt/src/geant4-v11.4.0/build
    
    # Run CMake (This is the critical step to test for missing dependencies)
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/geant4 \
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" \
          -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON \
          -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON \
          -DGEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11=ON \
          -DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON \
          ..
    
    # If CMake succeeds, the build environment is valid.
    # You can run 'make -j4' briefly to test compilation, then cancel it to save time.

**Step 3.4: Exit Sandbox**
Once verified, type `exit` to leave the container shell.

## 4. Create the Definition File

*Note: This file (`lab-physics.def`) should be managed in the project's git repository.*

Create `lab-physics.def`:

    nano lab-physics.def

Insert the validated configuration:

    Bootstrap: docker
    From: almalinux:9
    
    %files
        # Copy local assets into the container's temporary /tmp directory
        mvme2xy                 /opt/bin/mvme2xy
        dat2xy                  /opt/bin/dat2xy
        geant4-v11.4.0.tar.bz2  /tmp/geant4-source.tar.bz2
        talys.tar               /tmp/talys-source.tar
    
    %post
        # --- 1. System Prerequisites ---
        dnf install epel-release
        dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
        dnf update
    
        # Install Compilers & Build Tools
        # Note: gcc-gfortran is REQUIRED for Talys
        dnf install gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran make cmake git wget which tar bzip2
        
        # Install Geant4 Dependencies
        dnf install expat-devel xerces-c-devel libX11-devel libXmu-devel
    
        # Install CERN ROOT (via Package Manager)
        dnf install root python3-root
    
        # Create standard paths
        mkdir -p /opt/bin
    
        # --- 2. Install Talys 2.0 ---
        cd /opt
        tar -xf /tmp/talys-source.tar
        # The tarball creates a 'talys' directory (e.g., /opt/talys)
        
        cd /opt/talys/source
        
        # Compile directly using gfortran
        gfortran -c *.f *.f90
        gfortran *.o -o talys
        
        # Move binary to standard location
        mv talys /opt/bin/talys
        
        # Cleanup Talys build artifacts
        rm -f *.o
    
        # --- 3. Install Geant4 11.4.0 ---
        mkdir -p /opt/src
        cd /opt/src
        tar -xjf /tmp/geant4-source.tar.bz2
        
        mkdir -p /opt/src/geant4-v11.4.0/build
        cd /opt/src/geant4-v11.4.0/build
        
        # Compile with Broadwell Optimization (-march=native)
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/geant4 \
              -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
              -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" \
              -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON \
              -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON \
              -DGEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11=ON \
              -DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON \
              ..
        
        make -j$(nproc)
        make install
        
        # --- 4. Cleanup ---
        cd /opt
        rm -rf /opt/src
        rm -f /tmp/*.tar*
        dnf clean all
    
    %environment
        # --- System Path ---
        export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH
        
        # --- ROOT ---
        export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib64/root:$PYTHONPATH
        
        # --- Geant4 ---
        . /opt/geant4/bin/geant4.sh
        
        # --- Lab Metadata ---
        export LAB_VERSION="v1.0-2025-12-12"

    %runscript
        echo "Physics Lab Container ($LAB_VERSION)"
        exec "$@"

## 5. Build the Final Image

Once the definition file is ready, build the production image. This will likely take 30-60 minutes due to the Geant4 compilation.

    sudo apptainer build lab-physics-v1.sif lab-physics.def

## 6. Verification

Test the container locally before deploying.

    # 1. Test Custom Tools
    apptainer exec lab-physics-v1.sif mvme2xy --help
    
    # 2. Test Talys
    apptainer exec lab-physics-v1.sif talys < /dev/null
    
    # 3. Test Geant4 Environment
    apptainer exec lab-physics-v1.sif env | grep G4INSTALL

## 7. Deployment

Move the verified image to the shared storage.

    sudo mv lab-physics-v1.sif /home/software/containers/
    sudo chown eal:eal /home/software/containers/lab-physics-v1.sif
    sudo chmod 644 /home/software/containers/lab-physics-v1.sif
