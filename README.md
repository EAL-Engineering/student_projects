# Student Projects
This is a repository to store information on various student projects in the 
Edwards Accelerator Lab at Ohio University.

I've marked the repo as CC0 per the license file, which is the modern 
equivalent of Public Domain.  This means that anyone can take anything from
here and use it in any way they see fit.

## Organization

We need some of this.  I think the top-level folders need to be by project,
and within that create folders for individuals when it makes sense.

## Reference material

### Git/Versioning
 * https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

    This page describes how to use git (or other version control software) to 
    manage development of programs along multiple development "branches."
    You might initially think that this isn't something that you'll want to 
    do, but it turns out to be extremely handy when you're trying to take 
    some existing codebase and add some new feature.  You can also make
    new branches for things like a publication where the graphs need to be 
    formatted a particular way, without having to change your main code.
    
### Generative AI/ML
 * https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16417758

    Google is offering a 1 year subscription to Google AI Pro for free
    to students.  I often run up against the free plan limits when using
    ChatGPT and Claude especially.  Their new 2.5 Pro model seems to be 
    significantly improved for things like research.

### Documentation
 * https://app.diagrams.net/

    Online flow charting/diagraming software.  

 * https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
 
    Markdown basics

 * https://www2.latech.edu/~sajones/REU/Learning%20Exercises/Equation%20Editor%20Shortcut%20Commands.docx

    Information on Microsoft Equation Editor.  I'm quite certain I have a 
    better reference for this, but I can't find it today.
